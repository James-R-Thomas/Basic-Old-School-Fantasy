> You enter a dimly lit, circular room with a spiral staircase on the west wall. The room is cluttered with broken chairs and shards of shattered glass from long-forgotten windows. The room's floor is uneven and faint echoes of distant sounds penetrate the silence. As you stand and look around, you can see dim lights coming from above.

When the players chose to climb the stairs, read the following.

> The staircase looks like itâ€™s crafted from ancient, weathered stone, and intricate carvings of mythical creatures and swirling patterns adorn its railings. As you climb the staircase, the narrow, winding steps spiral upward, and the air becomes warmer with each step. At the top of the staircase, you find yourself in a small room with many windows. This room appears to have served as a lighthouse overseeing the vast desert landscape. 
><br> Birds nests can be seen around the rafters that are supporting several hanging lights by huge chains. The lights appear to be magical of some sort as if they are permanent lamps.

The lights are round metallic balls with a continual light spell cast upon them. They can be removed and carried if the players wish.

As the players search the room, there are four stirges living in the nests. As soon as the nests are touched, they will fly out and attack.
