>You cautiously enter a forgotten chamber, the air thick with a fine layer of dust. The room appears to have suffered the ravages of time and neglect, evident in the crumbled wall that exposes a glimpse of the outside world.
><br>A large section of the west wall has given way, leaving a gaping hole through which sunlight spills, casting a warm and hazy glow over the sandy debris that litters the floor. The ground beneath your feet is uneven, covered in a mixture of sand and broken stone, making each step uncertain.
><br>As you look around, you can vaguely see what appears to be the corner of some kind of stone sarcophagus as it lies almost completely buried beneath the sand.

The sarcophagus contains the mummy Gothbert.

When the players move the heavy lid off of the sarcophagus, read the following.

>As you move the heavy lid off, all of a sudden an outstretched hand emerges. Then, two hands grab the lid and throw it to the ground. Emerging from the sarcophagus, a linen wrapped shape stands before you.

After having worn the Amulet of the Undead for so long, Gothbert himself turned into a mummy. This is the curse of the Amulet. The wearer will eventually turn into an undead.

Once Gothbert is defeated and the Amulet is removed from his corpse, no new undead will be created however any that were already created will still be active and the players will encounter them.

When the players search the sarcophagus after defeating Gothbert, they find the following:
2 rubies (1000gp each)
1 ornate gold dagger (500gp)
1500 gold pieces
scroll of Protection from Undead
