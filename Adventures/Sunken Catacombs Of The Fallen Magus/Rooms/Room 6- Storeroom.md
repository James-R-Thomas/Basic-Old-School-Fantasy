> As you push open the creaking door, you find yourself standing on the threshold of a storeroom. Faint rays of sunlight filter through cracks in the dilapidated stone walls, casting dim, uneven illumination on the dusty remnants within.
><br>The storeroom is cluttered with decaying wooden crates, broken barrels and shattered pottery that lie scattered across the uneven stone floor. Far across the room you just barely see a few intact crates and barrels that have managed to withstand the ravages of time.

As the players search the kitchen, there are 3 giant rats that live within the debris. They will jump out and attack the party.

After defeating the rats, if the players search the remainder of the room, they find the following:

1 bag of 25gp
3 cloaks in good condition 
1 leather helmet
1 pair leather boots
