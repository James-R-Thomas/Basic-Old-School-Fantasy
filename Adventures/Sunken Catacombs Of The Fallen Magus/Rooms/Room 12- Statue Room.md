>You have entered into some sort of shrine room, the air thick with an aura of quiet reverence. The room is dimly lit by the soft glow of faintly phosphorescent fungi clinging to the walls, casting a muted illumination that barely penetrates the shadows.
><br>Around the room, faded tapestries hang from the walls, depicting scenes of celestial wonders and divine interventions. Flickering candle sconces, long extinguished, line the walls, their wax drippings frozen in time. Dilapidated pews, now covered in sand, stand in orderly rows in the center.
><br>On the far side of the room stands a solemn statue, a representation of a deity or figure of reverence.
><br>The statue looks crafted in jade with meticulous detail, arms outstretched and the eyes fixed in eternal contemplation. The statue's features evoke a sense of serenity, yet a shroud of sadness seems to linger, as if the deity it represents has passed into the realm of the dead.
><br>The sand has embraced the statue's base, partially burying it in a delicate blanket that reaches up to the figure's knees.
><br>The statue's outstretched hand holds an orb of some kind with jade whispering flames as if they were exploding from within it.


The statue is a Jade Living Statue.

Once the players search and get too close to the statue, it will activate and begin attacking.

These normal-sized statues are highly magic resistant and make savings throws as a 10th-level fighter. They are immune to nonmagical weapons and even magical weapons confer no bonuses to attack or damage rolls when sued against them. When destroyed, they crumble to worthless powder.
