>This must have been the wizard’s bedroom. The furniture, once elegant, now stands as decayed memories of a forgotten era. The floor, covered in sand, crunches softly underfoot as you explore.
><br>The bed, draped in dusty and moth-eaten curtains, sits against one wall. The mattress has long lost its resilience, and the bedframe groans under the weight of accumulated neglect. The sheets, once luxurious, are now stained and faded.
><br>A wooden wardrobe in one corner stands partially ajar, its doors hanging loosely from their hinges.
><br>There is a large pile of sand in the southwest corner of the room with various debris protruding from within it.

As the players explore the room, once they get too close to the large sand pile, a giant sand spider will leap out and attack the nearest party member

Examining the wardrobe will reveal the following:
Heavy wool cloak
Two shirts
Boots of Levitation

### Boots of Levitation:

The wearer may levitate (as if using the magic-user spell). There is no limit to the duration.

Sand spiders are carnivorous creatures six feet long. They are beige with an orange-and-black blotch on their stomachs. They inhabit desert or barren regions, living in underground burrows, usually near rocky structures or stones. Pyramids, large statues, rocky crags, and paved roads offer the best sites.

Sand spiders do not build webs to trap prey. Instead, they burrow just below the surface of the ground, then burst out to attack as the prey passes overhead. This gives them the benefit of surprise on a roll of 1d4 on 1d6. The bite of a sand spider causes 1d6 points of damage, and in addition, the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or be paralyzed for 1d4+4 hours.
