>After descending another stone staircase, you enter into a large chamber with an exit on the north wall. The chamber, dimly lit by the diffuse glow of phosphorescent fungi clinging to the walls, is blanketed in a layer of sand that seems to have seeped in from unseen crevices.
><br>The room's focal point is a massive mural that adorns the east wall. Crafted with meticulous detail, the mural depicts a grand and fantastical battle of wizards. Towering figures, their robes billowing dramatically, face an army of knights in a magical clash of elements. Arcane energies swirl and clash, illuminating the scene with bursts of vibrant colors that seem to leap from the mural itself.
><br>The rest of the chamber bears the marks of time and abandonment. Crumbled stone fragments and remnants of broken furniture lie scattered about, forgotten relics from a time when this room may have held significance.

There is nothing of value in this room. The various murals depict the battle of Wizardspire along with other battles against dragons. Some of the murals are more decorative and depict images of celestial events.
