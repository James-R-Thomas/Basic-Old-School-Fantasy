>This room appears to be empty. Mainly serving as a causeway to other sections of the catacombs.
><br>The ceiling has a caved in area creating a skylight into the room. The walls are made of rough-hewn stone with pillars stretching from floor to ceiling.
><br>The room is devoid of furniture or decoration, presenting a blank canvas that hints at its utilitarian purpose.
><br>The floor is made of well-worn stone tiles, their surface bearing the marks of countless footsteps over time. You notice a subtle draft from the eastern doorway. As you look at the floor, there is more sand starting to cover it over on the eastern side.
