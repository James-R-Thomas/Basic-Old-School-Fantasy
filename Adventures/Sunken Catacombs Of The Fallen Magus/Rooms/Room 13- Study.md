>This room was the wizard's study, a room steeped in the mystique of arcane knowledge and adorned with remnants of the ancient past. The walls are covered in intricate tapestries depicting celestial phenomena, magical sigils, and scenes of ancient rituals. Faint runes are etched into the floor, protective wards and mystical diagrams that once fueled the wizard's studies.
><br>Bookshelves line the walls, their shelves filled with dusty grimoires, ancient scrolls, and vials containing exotic reagents. The spines of the books bear faded titles in languages both forgotten and arcane.
><br>There is a large, ornate desk in the center of the room, covered in a layer of dust that testifies to years of neglect. A candelabra rests on the desk, still glowing as if it will never go out. The soft glow illuminates the room in a way that accentuates the abandoned scholar's retreat.
><br>On the desk, scattered parchments and ink-stained quills bear witness to the last moments of scholarly pursuit before abandonment.

Examining the books will reveal there are 10 books that are still intact. Most are unreadable by the players. They will probably have worth to some higher level mages in the larger towns such as Melinir.

Examining the bookshelves reveals several jars filled with different colored liquids. There isnâ€™t any writing on them so the players will not know what they are. They could be normal drinking liquids or they could be potions.

### Blue liquid: Diminution:

Anyone taking this potion immediately shrinks to 6 inches in height and can do no damage when physically attacking a creature larger than 1 foot tall. The user can slip through small cracks and has a 90% chance of not being seen when standing still. This potion negates a potion of growth.

There is only one vial of blue liquid.

### Green liquid: Growth:

This potion causes the user to grow to twice normal size, temporarily increasing Strength (doubling it, up to 18 maximum) and giving the ability to inflict double damage (twice the amount rolled) on any successful hit. The user's hit points, however, do not increase. This potion negates a potion of diminution.

There is only one vial of green liquid.

### Red liquid: Gaseous Form:

Upon drinking this potion, the user's body takes the form of a cloud of gas. Anything the user is carrying or wearing falls through the gaseous body to land on the floor. The user keeps control over his body: he can move through small holes in walls, chests, and so forth. Any creature or character in gaseous form cannot attack, but has an AC of -2 and cannot be harmed by non-magical weapons.

There are two vials of red liquid.

### Yellow liquid: Healing:

Like the clerical cure light wounds spell, drinking this potion restores 1d6 + 1 lost hit points or cures paralysis for one creature.

There are two vials of yellow liquid.
