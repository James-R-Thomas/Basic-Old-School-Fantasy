>This room must have been the barracks. The room, once a place of camaraderie and shared stories, now stands as a testament to the passage of time. Rows of bunk beds line the walls, their wooden frames creaking under the weight of broken and splintered planks. Tattered remnants of moldy bedding cling to the skeletal structures.
><br>As your eyes pan the room, you notice personal effects scattered amidst the wreckage such as sword pieces and discarded pieces of armor.

There are 3d4 skeletons that are within this room.

They were part of Augustufâ€™s expedition party and once others started to be turned to undead, they barricaded themselves in this room. Unfortunately both men succumbed to wounds they had and died, thus they too were turned into skeletons by the Amulet of the Undead.
