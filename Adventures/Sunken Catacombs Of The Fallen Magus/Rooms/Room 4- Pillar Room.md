> As you step into a grand chamber, the air is heavy with the scent of ancient stone and dust. The room is expansive, supported by rows of majestic stone pillars that stretch toward the vaulted ceiling.
><br>Between the pillars, life-sized statues of figures and fantastical beings line the chamber, their stony gazes fixed in perpetuity. Some depict noble knights in majestic poses, while others capture the likeness of mythical creatures. The chamber's floor is paved with large worn stones. At the north end of the room, you can see a raised dais that has a weathered ornate pedestal centered upon it.
><br>As your eyes explore the room, you notice hidden alcoves and niches where treasures may have once been displayed. The chamber seems to hold the remnants of a forgotten sanctuary or a place of worship, where the pillars and statues served not only as architectural supports but also as symbols of power, magic, and reverence.

There is nothing of value in this room.

The pedestal is ornately carved out of a solid block of obsidian. It has nothing resting on it. There are ten statues that are all carved from stone. No treasure is found in the niches.
