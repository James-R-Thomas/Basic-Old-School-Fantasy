This adventure begins when the characters are summoned before Mayor Valum at Melinir’s Town Hall. Whether or not the players have already completed prior adventures in Thunder Rift, the mayor will already know of their exploits. If the game is not being played as part of a campaign based in Thunder Rift, the DM should feel free to change the names of people and places given here to match those in his or her own game world.

When the players are ready to begin play, the Dungeon Master should start the game by reading aloud the following text.

>After arriving in Melinir last evening and checking in at the Watchtower, you were directed to go to the finest inn in all of Thunder Rift, The Sarcastic Goat Inn. Rooms were ready and waiting on your arrival.
><br>The innkeeper, Bediah Bulon, greeted you and assigned you the best rooms he had to offer.
><br>After a good night's sleep the city scribe, an elf named Connor, comes to escort you to the Town Hall for your meeting. He leads you out of the inn to a carriage that is waiting for you.
><br>After a brief carriage ride, Connor leads you into the Town Hall to the mayor’s office. As you enter into the office, you notice the intricate statues and other artwork adorning the room. There’s even a portrait of the Quadrial hanging on the wall.
><br>Mayor Valum is sitting behind his large oak desk and rises to greet you.
><br>_Hello brave adventurers! I am so glad you have come. Your reputation precedes you and I am in dire need of your help. I’m hoping your skills and insights can help me._
><br>_Several weeks ago my nephew, Augustuf, left to lead an expedition to the Bone Hills to investigate a strange catacomb that was recently discovered there. It is supposed to be where a mage from Wizardspire dwelt. Augustuf heard tales of it from some travelers and became very passionate about _discovering its secrets. Supposedly, the mage had acquired some sort of magical amulet during his expeditions._
><br>_Unfortunately he has never returned and we’ve had no word about his endeavors. My sister and I are beginning to get very worried that something may have happened._
><br>_I am hoping you will accept this mission to go and find out what has happened to him and his party as well as investigate the catacomb._
><br>_I will reward you handsomely upon your return of course._

Give the PCs a chance to respond to the mayor. They can ask any questions they have about the catacombs and its history. He won’t have a lot of information but there are several rumors that have circulated for years about the place.

Mayor Valum will be able to offer the following information if questioned.

**About the lost wizard:** The wizard’s name is Gothbert. He was expelled from Wizardspire for delving into forbidden magic and known for always traveling to find hidden tombs and magical items.

**About the catacombs:** Little is known about it but it is said to be multiple levels and have a full company of guards protecting it.

**About the reward:** Mayor Valum will offer 100 gold pieces per party member and the party can keep anything they find in the catacombs. He just hopes for the safe return of Augustuf.

**About the amulet:** Mayor Valum doesn’t know anything about the [[Amulet of the Undead]]. See the description below for further information about it.
