If the players completed the full adventure, they should now be in possession of both of Augustuf’s belongings, his ring and his diary.

They can return to Melinir and report back to Mayor Valum about what happened to his nephew and the expedition party.

Read the following aloud to the players once they are ready to finish the module.

>After arriving in Melinir last evening and checking in at the Watchtower, you made your way to The Sarcastic Goat Inn. Bediah Bulon greeted you and assigned you the best rooms he had to offer again, especially after hearing rumors that you had found Mayor Valum’s nephew.
><br>After a night's sleep the city scribe, Connor, again comes to escort you to the Town Hall for your meeting. He leads you out of the inn to the same carriage that you used before.
><br>After arriving at the Town Hall, Connor leads you directly to the mayor’s office. As you enter the office, you notice Mayor Valum is not alone. There is a woman sitting in his chair while the mayor is standing close to her.
><br>_Hello and welcome back. I am so glad you have come with news of my nephew and his expedition._
><br>_This is my sister, Edwina. She is the mother of Augustuf._
><br>_So please, tell me any news about him. Were you able to find him? Or know what happened to him?_
><br>_And what of this long lost catacomb? Can you tell me anything about it as well?_
><br>As you begin to recount your adventure into the catacombs and of the fate of Augustuf and his party, you reach into your bag and retrieve the ring and diary.
><br>Handing them to Mayor Valum, Edwina starts to break down and cry. Mayor Valum comforts her as he listens to the rest of your story.
><br>After you finish telling him of your adventure, he says to you:
><br>_My friends, I am so grateful that you returned to us Augustuf’s possessions and that you were able to finally tell us of his fate. I wish the news had been better, but Augustuf was always getting into trouble as a youth. It seems he carried that trait with him as an adult._
><br>_Thank you again for all that you have done for myself and my sister._
><br>_As you know, times are tough here in Melinir, but please accept these tokens as payment for completing your mission. Know that you are always welcome in Melinir and will always have the best rooms at The Sarcastic Goat Inn._
><br>Mayor Valum hands you several bags and bids you farewell.
><br>Connor leads you back outside to the waiting carriage to carry you back to The Sarcastic Goat Inn.
><br>There you open the bags to see what Mayor Valum has given you.

- 500 gold pieces
- Dagger +1 
- Potion of Healing 
- Bag of Holding

Regarding the items found in the catacombs, if the players wish to have the potions, treasure, and books appraised and identified, it is up to the DM to state the prices for doing so and inform the players of what the items are.
