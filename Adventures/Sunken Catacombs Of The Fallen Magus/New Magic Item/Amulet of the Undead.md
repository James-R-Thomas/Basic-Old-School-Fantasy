# Amulet of the Undead

The Amulet of the Undead is a mysterious and powerful magical necklace forged in the shadows of ancient tombs and steeped in necromantic energies. This amulet, adorned with eerie symbols and dark gemstones, is both a coveted treasure and a perilous artifact.

The Amulet of the Undead is said to have been created by a long-forgotten necromancer seeking ultimate power over life and death. Its whereabouts are often obscured by myths and legends, with some claiming it is guarded by ancient curses and traps in a hidden tomb, while others insist it has been wielded by dark lords throughout history.

## Appearance: 
The amulet consists of a dark, weathered metal chain adorned with an intricately designed pendant. The pendant is crafted from obsidian and etched with ominous glyphs that seem to writhe and pulse with an otherworldly energy. At its center, a blood-red gemstone captures the essence of the underworld, casting an unsettling glow.

## Abilities:

### Undead Domination:

The primary power of the amulet allows its wearer to exert control over the undead. When worn, the amulet grants the ability to command and influence nearby undead creatures, compelling them to follow the wearer's commands. The Amulet will revive any person or creature within a mile radius that perishes while the necklace is being worn and active. Thus, it gives the wearer the power to continue to create new undead. Once the necklace is removed from the wearer, the curse will be broken and no new undead are created. However, those undead that have already been created will continue to be active.

### Mummification Transformation:

However, the dark magic within the amulet comes at a cost. The more the wearer uses the amulet's power, the closer they become to a transformation. Prolonged use of the amulet gradually turns the wearer into a mummy, an undead guardian bound by ancient curses and wrapped in bandages. The transformation is irreversible, and as the wearer succumbs to the curse, they gain additional powers associated with mummification.

## Drawbacks:

### Curse of the Mummy:

The wearer begins to take on physical characteristics of a mummy, such as desiccated skin, hollow eyes, and a slow, shuffling gait. The curse also weakens the wearer's connection to the living world, making them increasingly isolated.

### Undead Attraction:

(The amulet's power may attract unwanted attention from other undead beings, drawn to the wielder's dark aura. This can lead to challenging encounters and potential threats from rival necromancers or those seeking to destroy the amulet.
