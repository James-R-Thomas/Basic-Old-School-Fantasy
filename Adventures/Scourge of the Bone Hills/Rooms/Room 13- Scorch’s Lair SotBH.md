>As you begin walking through the entrance to this room, an oppressive heat immediately envelops you. The air is thick with the scent of scorched stone and smoldering embers, creating an atmosphere both intense and ominous. The dim light within the cavern is provided by small fires scattered throughout, casting flickering shadows that dance across the uneven walls.
><br>The crackling of the scattered fires echoes in the lair, and the occasional hiss of escaping steam punctuates the air. The cavern, bathed in the dim glow of the scattered fires, serves as both a testament to the dragon's might and a warning to any who dare to enter its fiery abode.
><br>The cave's interior reveals some of the dragon's hoard, a collection of gleaming treasures, bathed in the fiery glow. The glint of gold, jewels, and metallic objects reflects the ambient light, creating a mesmerizing spectacle amidst the darkness.

If the players previously were in room 12 with the toad, there is a 95% chance that Scorch heard the battle and will be ready for them.

If Scorch heard the previous battle with the toad, read the following.

>The dragon itself, with scales the color of molten lava, lounges majestically on its hoard, its eyes fixated on your intrusion.

If Scorch did not hear the previous battle, read the following.

>As you peer around the room, the colossal form of the red dragon lies sprawled across its hoard, its scales reflecting the ambient firelight. Each rise and fall of its massive chest indicates the deep slumber of the formidable creature. The cavernous space is filled with a hushed stillness, broken only by the gentle crackling of the fires and the rhythmic sound of the dragon's slow breaths.

Most of Scorchâ€™s treasure is in room 14, but some of it is here:

3000 cp
2000 sp
1500 gp

Leather armor + 1
Shield + 1
Sword + 1

**Scorch is a non-magic using dragon.**
