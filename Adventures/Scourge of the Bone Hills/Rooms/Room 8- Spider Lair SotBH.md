>Descending the natural stairway in the small cave hallway, the air grows cooler, and the sound of each step reverberates through the ancient stone. The narrow passage gradually widens, revealing a hidden expanse beneath the earth. The stone steps, worn smooth by the passage of time, guide your descent downward.
><br>Stepping into an expansive chamber, you find yourself surrounded by the soft glow of bioluminescent fungus, casting an eerie yet enchanting light in the darkness. The walls are adorned with these natural light sources, creating a mesmerizing display that dances along the cave's contours. As your eyes adjust to the gentle illumination, you notice the intricate silk strands of several large spider webs suspended between stalactites and stalagmites.
><br>The cavernous space, adorned with both the delicate beauty of the glowing fungus and the intricate architecture of the spider webs, creates a mysterious underworld where nature's wonders converge in a breathtaking display.

If any party member touches a web, this alerts the spider. The spider will jump down from a higher ledge and attack the party. The spider will have initiative to attack.

If a party member touches the web themselves, they must make a saving throw vs. paralysis at +2 or be paralyzed.

If a web is not touched, after a period of time searching the area, the spider slowly crawls down the ledge and surprises the party - each side rolls for initiative.

- There are 50 gold pieces found in a small leather bag in a corner of the room.
