>Venturing into the expansive cavern, your senses are immediately captivated by the vastness of the space. The ceiling soars overhead, adorned with intricate stalactites that hang like frozen daggers. The rocky floor stretches wide, interrupted only by the occasional stalagmite, standing sentinel in the dimly lit chamber. The air carries a cool, damp embrace, echoing with the whispers of unseen water droplets.
><br>On the far side of the cavern, a large pool of water reflects the ambient glow emanating from scattered patches of luminous fungus. The glowing fungus adorns the walls and rocky outcrops, turning the cave into a canvas of radiant hues. The stillness of the water in the pool adds a tranquil element to the scene, mirroring the delicate illumination above.
><br>As you gaze towards the distant reaches of the cavern, dancing lights flicker like elusive fireflies. These distant lights create an enchanting spectacle, beckoning you deeper into the subterranean expanse.
><br>Lying in wait beside the pool, is a pair of rock toads. As the players approach and begin searching the area, the toads will leap into the air and surprise the party.

Each side rolls for initiative.

Each party member, before they can attack, must **save vs. paralysis**, or be paralyzed for 2-8 (2d4) rounds. The players must continue to roll each time until the toad is killed unless they specify they do not look at the toad when attacking.

- There is nothing of value found in this room.
