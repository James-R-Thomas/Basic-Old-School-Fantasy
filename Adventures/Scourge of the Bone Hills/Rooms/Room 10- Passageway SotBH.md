>Stepping into the wide hallway, the scene unfolds before you in a disarray of scattered debris. Broken fragments of what once might have been creatures of the dark now lie haphazardly across the floor, creating a chaotic landscape. Dust particles dance in the air, caught in the dim light. The atmosphere is heavy with a sense of abandonment, and the silence is broken only by the occasional creaking of loose rubble settling.
><br>In front of you, the air seems to ripple and move, creating a visual distortion that draws your attention. Peering through this mysterious shimmer, you catch a glimpse of the other sideâ€”an exit obscured by the undulating air as if something is between you and the other side.

There is a gelatinous cube within this chamber hallway. Players can detect it with a roll of 1 or 2 on a 1d6. If no player detects the cube, the first player walking through the chamber will run into it and be surprised and the cube will get initiative to attack.

Inside the gelatinous cube are the following:

25 gold pieces
1 long sword
