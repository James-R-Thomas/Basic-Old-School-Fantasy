>Entering the expansive cave, you find yourself in the heart of a dragon's treasure trove, an awe inspiring display of wealth and opulence. The cavernous chamber is dimly illuminated by the warm, flickering light of small fires around the room, casting a golden hue on the vast collection of treasures. The air is heavy with the scent of riches, and the low hum of magical energy permeates the atmosphere.
><br>In the center of the cavern stands a magnificent obsidian statue, reaching towards the ceiling with an imposing presence. The dark, reflective surface of the statue contrasts sharply with the surrounding treasures, creating a focal point that draws the eye. The intricate details of the statue showcase the craftsmanship and artistry that went into its creation. At its feet lay a golden chest with red ornate decorations at every corner.
><br>The dragon's hoard is spread in every direction, a mesmerizing sight that includes gleaming gold coins, sparkling gems, and ancient artifacts. The flickering fires dance across the metallic surfaces, creating a dazzling interplay of light and shadow.
><br>As you move through the treasure room, the magnitude of the dragon's wealth becomes increasingly apparent.

As the players search the treasure vault, once they approach and touch the golden chest, the statue comes alive. The statue is an obsidian golem and once triggered, will begin attacking the party. Each side rolls for initiative.
