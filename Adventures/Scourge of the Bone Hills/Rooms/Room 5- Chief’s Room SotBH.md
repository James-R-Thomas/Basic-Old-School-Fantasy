>After walking through the connecting passage, the area opens up into a larger, dimly lit chamber adorned with crude symbols and primitive decorations. At the back of the cave, sitting upon a makeshift throne constructed of mismatched bones and salvaged materials, is the imposing figure of the goblin chief.
><br>He is surrounded by five goblins who have their swords drawn and are waiting for your arrival.
><br>The cave echoes with a guttural growl as the goblin chief, recognizing you as a threat, brandishes a large war hammer and rises from the throne. The chamber, once a space for the goblin chief's dominion, transforms into a battleground as the chief readies for an attack.

Thraxxus carries a magic war hammer +1. There is also a small chest behind his throne that contains the following:

100 gold pieces 
Potion of Healing 
Gold necklace (50 gp)
