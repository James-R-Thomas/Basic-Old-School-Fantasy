>Further into the cave, the passageway widens, revealing a vast chamber supported by imposing stalactites and stalagmites. The cavern echoes with the distant drip of water, hinting at an underground reservoir.
><br>As your eyes adjust to the low light, across the room you notice four goblins standing guard near the entrance to a narrow passage leading deeper into the cave. The goblins, clad in crude leather armor and armed with rusted weapons, eye you suspiciously. Their greenish skin is tinged with a sickly hue, and their pointed ears twitch as they exchange wary glances.
><br>The atmosphere in the room crackles with tension as the goblins size you up, deciding whether you pose a threat or if you are just another intruder wandering into the perilous domain guarded by their fearsome master.

There are four goblins stationed at the main entrance. They will wait to see what the players do. If the players advance into the cave, they will both come around a rock barricade and attack.
