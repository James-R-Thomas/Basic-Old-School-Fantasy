>As you venture into the cave, the passageway opens up into a larger chamber, revealing a crude gathering area. The air is thick with the scent of burning wood and the pungent odor of goblin presence. The cavern's ceiling is adorned with luminescent fungi, casting a dim glow on the rocky walls. In the center of the space, a fire pit crackles, surrounded by various makeshift seats and scattered belongings.
><br>Five goblins are huddled around the fire, cooking over its flickering flames. The atmosphere seems relatively calm until their pointed ears twitch, detecting your intrusion. In an instant, the goblins abandon their culinary tasks, drawing rusty swords with a menacing clatter and begin running towards you.
