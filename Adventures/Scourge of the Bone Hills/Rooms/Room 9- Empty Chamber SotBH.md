>Stepping into the large cave chamber, an impenetrable darkness surrounds you, with no trace of natural light. The air is cool and damp. As your eyes adjust, scattered patches of glowing fungus reveal themselves, casting an eerie illumination on the cavern's features. The radiant light bathes the chamber in a soft, otherworldly glow, emphasizing the rugged terrain that lies beneath.
><br>The rocky ground is littered with a haunting display of scattered bones, remnants of creatures long gone, their forms gradually merging with the earth. Among the skeletal remains, very old and rusty pieces of equipment, once used for mysterious subterranean tasks, lay dormant. The silence is broken only by the occasional drip of water from stalactites overhead, echoing through the cave.
><br>Amidst the skeletal fragments and rusty tools, stalagmites rise from the ground while stalactites hang like ancient chandeliers from the unseen heights of the cavern ceiling. The cavern feels like a forgotten vault, where the remnants of the past and the enduring beauty of the glowing fungi coexist in a haunting harmony.

There is no threat in this room nor are there any items of any value.
