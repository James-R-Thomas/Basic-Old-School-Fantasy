>Descending a natural stairway that winds its way into a larger cave, guttural voices and other noises reverberate through the narrow passage. As you reach the bottom, you find yourself in a dimly lit chamber that serves as the quarters of a group of goblins. The rough hewn walls are adorned with crude drawings, and various beds and pieces of furniture are strewn haphazardly, creating an atmosphere of disarray.
><br>In the flickering light, you notice ten goblins hastily gathering swords and equipping themselves for battle. The metallic clinks of weapons being unsheathed resonate in the cave, creating an ominous soundtrack to the unfolding scene. The goblins, with their sharp features and greenish skin, eye you with a mix of hostility and determination.
><br>The cave's confined space makes their preparations appear even more urgent, with shadows dancing across the chaotic array of beds and furniture.
><br>As you stand at the entrance, the goblins, ready to defend their quarters, prepare to launch an attack.
