If the players are successful in defeating Scorch and the foul creatures that inhabited his lair, they have earned praise from The Quadrial as well as the rest of Thunder Rift.

They also received a special invitation from Mayor Valum in Melinir to receive the key to the town.

Read the following aloud to the players:
>After arriving in Melinir last evening and checking in at the Watchtower, you made your way to The Sarcastic Goat Inn. Bediah Bulon greeted you and assigned you the best rooms he had to offer, especially after hearing of your recent battle with Scorch in the Bone Hills. After a night's sleep the city scribe, Connor, comes to escort you to the Town Hall for your meeting. He leads you out of the inn to a carriage that waits for you.
><br>After arriving at the Town Hall, Connor leads you directly to the mayorâ€™s office. As you enter the office, you notice Mayor Valum is not alone. There are several others there as well. Councilman Baur, the Councilman of Kleine, and Gustovan, the Burgomaster of Torlynn are among them.
><br>Mayor Valum stands and walks over to the party.
><br>_Brave adventurers, champions of Thunder Rift, on behalf of The Quadrial and all the grateful inhabitants of this valley, I extend my deepest thanks._
><br>_Your valor and determination have not only rid us of the scourge that was Scorch but have also restored peace to our once troubled lands._
><br>_The Quadrial's call was answered by a group of individuals who embodied true heroism. Your efforts in confronting the dragon in the desolate Bone Hills have not only safeguarded Melinir and Kleine and Torlynn but have resonated throughout Thunder Rift. The defeat of Scorch marks a turning point for that region, and your names will be forever etched in the annals of our history._
><br>_A new mention has also been inscribed into Melinir's history book of Thunder Rift with your names listed for all future generations to know of your triumph._
><br>_Please accept this key to the town as our token of appreciation._

This is the aftermath of defeating Scorch and the effect on Thunder Rift.

><br>The defeat of the infamous red dragon, Scorch, in the desolate Bone Hills within the Valley of Thunder Rift, became a defining moment for the region. The Bone Hills, once a feared and abandoned area, served as Scorch's lair, where the dragon amassed its hoard and terrorized the surrounding settlements.
><br>In response to the escalating threat, the renowned adventuring group known as The Quadrial took charge, sending out a desperate call for aid to anyone willing to enter the foreboding lair and slay the menacing beast.
><br>A diverse and skilled coalition of adventurers answered The Quadrial's call, forming a formidable force to confront Scorch. After a challenging and perilous journey, the adventurers successfully infiltrated the Bone Hills, engaging the red dragon in an epic battle. Through strategic prowess and sheer determination, they managed to defeat Scorch, bringing an end to the dragon's reign of terror.
><br>The news of Scorch's demise spread like wildfire through the Valley of Thunder Rift. Towns such as Melinir, Kleine, and Torlynn, experienced a profound sense of relief and joy. The dragon's lair, once a symbol of fear, was reclaimed, and the area surrounding the Bone Hills was restored to peace.
><br>In the aftermath, the larger towns of Melinir, Kleine, and Torlynn, reopened trade routes to all of the smaller settlements that surrounded the Bone Hills.
