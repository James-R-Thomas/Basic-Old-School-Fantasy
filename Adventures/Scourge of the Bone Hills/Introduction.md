_Scourge of the Bone Hills_ is a 14-page adventure for the new DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® game. This module is best used for a high level party of adventurers. It’s possible a single player could succeed but some encounters may need to be scaled down in difficulty.

Note that boxed text should be read aloud to the players. Explanatory text for the DM’s eyes only follows the boxed text; the DM should read the material silently before revealing it to the players.

# What’s Needed to Play?

The only things needed to enjoy this adventure are the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® game rule book, paper and pencil, and some dice.

This adventure is set in the valley of Thunder Rift. Full information about this wondrous place can be found in the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS® game supplement of the same name. It is not necessary to own that product to play this adventure, however; this module can be used in any campaign setting with ease.

# Adventure Overview

The red dragon has made its lair deep within the heart of the desolate Bone Hills, guarding a hoard of riches and terrorizing the surrounding lands.

Upon defeating the red dragon, the adventurers claim its hoard, which may include vast amounts of gold, magical artifacts, and other valuable treasures. The region is freed from the dragon's tyranny, and the party gains renown within Thunder Rift.

# Monster Statistics

Throughout this adventure, the players will be called upon to have their characters battle various enemies. Whenever such encounters occur, information about the enemy will be presented in the following format:

  

Monster Name (number encountered): AC (Armor Class); HD (Hit Dice); hp (hit points); MV (Movement Rate); NoAT (Number of Attacks); THAC0 (see below); Dmg (Damage inflicted per attack); Save as (type of character that the monster’s saving throws are made as); ML (Moral); AL (Alignment); XP (Experience Points earned for defeating the monster); Treasure (Any valuables carried by the monster).

One of these notations, THAC0, may be unfamiliar to new players and DMs. THAC0 is simply an acronym for “To Hit Armor Class 0.” To determine the roll that a DM must make on a 1d20 for a monster to hit an enemy in combat, simply subtract the target’s Armor Class from this number. Thus, if a monster with a THAC0 of 15 is attacking a character who has an AC of 7, the monster will hit on a roll of 8 or better.

# Wandering Monsters

From time to time, the DM may wish to introduce a wandering monster into the game. There is no strict rule in this adventure about when such encounters should occur. Generally, consider using them when the game is slowing down or if the players’ party is too strong for the adventure.

Use the following table for generating random wandering monster encounters.

Roll 1d12         Monster                  No. Appearing 1-2   Centipede, Giant                                 1d4

3-4                   Rat, Giant                                1d4

5-6                   Bat, Giant                                1d10

7-8                   Scorpion, Giant                       1d6

9-10                 Carrion crawler                       1d4

11-12               Beetle, Giant Fire                    1d8

Statistics for monsters are described in the Rule Book in the D&D game.
