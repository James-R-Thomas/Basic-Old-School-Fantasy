- Shroud spiders are six feet long and black all over except for their eyes, which glow with a very faint blue light (visible up to 50 feet away in the dark). These magical creatures are intelligent and very evil. They can only be hit by magical or silver weapons.

- The spider’s vicious bite is poisonous. Any character bitten must make a saving throw vs. poison or be paralyzed for 2d4 turns. The spider uses this attack to take live victims for its food store.

- The web of the shroud spider is as strong as the webs of other giant spiders but is not very sticky. Instead, anyone touching a fresh web (less than 24 hours old) must make a saving throw vs. paralysis at +2 or be paralyzed. Victims remain paralyzed for as long as they are in contact with the web and for 2 rounds thereafter.

- Shroud spiders do not usually make large webs, but they can shoot a strand of web at a single opponent up to 30 feet away. Any creature hit by the strand must make a saving throw vs. paralysis at +1 or be paralyzed. The spiders also use their web strands to trap victims in a paralyzing shroud before placing them in their food store.

- They also sometimes lay simple traps of web which they renew each day. Characters placed in the food store remain in a state of suspended animation until the webbing is removed. A shroud spider normally eats the prey in its food store in three days to a month.
