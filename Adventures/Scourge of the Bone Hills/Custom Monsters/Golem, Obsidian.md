- A golem is a "construct," a powerful, enchanted monster created and animated by a high level magic-user or cleric. Golems can be made of almost any material.

- Golems can only be damaged by magic or magical weapons. They are also immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells, as well as all gases (since they do not breathe).

- Golems made of obsidian will appear as sharp-featured humanoids carved of this black glass. Obsidian golems have only low intelligence, but they have the power of speech, and can be controlled by simple commands, passwords, or riddles. In combat, an obsidian golem reduced to 0 hit points will shatter into worthless rubble.
