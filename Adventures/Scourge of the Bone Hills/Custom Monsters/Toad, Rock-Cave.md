- A rock toad, or "cave toad", lives in rocky, cold regions such as high mountains or frozen deserts. It is about the size of a large dog, weighs 150 pounds, and carries a hard, bumpy shell on its back (like a turtle).

- On its head, it has bulging, multi-faceted eyes similar to a fly's. The eyes shine with a hypnotic glow. Any creature gazing into the eyes must save vs. paralysis, or be paralyzed for 2-8 (2d4) rounds.

- The eyes will continue to cast a feeble light (5' radius) for 1d3 hours after the creature dies, but the hypnotic powers will be lost. When attacking, it bites with a horny, beaked mouth.
