Over the years, Scorch has allowed several different creatures to make their home within its lair. These creatures act as a natural deterrent for any unwanted visitors.

Scorch has also enlisted a group of goblins to be the guardians of the front entrance. A small garrison has set up their home in the front chambers of the cave system. They are led by a goblin chief named Thraxxus. Whenever they capture someone entering into the caves, they force them to go further into the lower caves to be food for the various creatures that inhabit those areas.

When the players are ready to begin the adventure, read the following text to start.

>After several hard days of travel, as you approach the entrance of the cave system nestled within the arid and rugged mountain range, you find yourself standing before a massive, weathered rock facade. The entrance is concealed amidst the harsh terrain, blending seamlessly with the surrounding rocky landscape. Jagged peaks loom overhead, casting elongated shadows that dance across the uneven ground.
><br>The mouth of the cave is a dark, foreboding portal, partially obscured by layers of ancient sediment and the residue of countless years of wind and sand erosion. The arid winds whistle through narrow crevices, creating an eerie symphony that reverberates through the desolate surroundings.
><br>As you venture inside, the temperature drops noticeably, and the air becomes thick with an earthy scent. The initial passage is a narrow, twisting corridor, with uneven rocky walls.
><br>As you progress deeper into the cave system, you notice subtle signs of the dragon's presenceâ€”large scales scattered across the ground, the occasional glint of red shimmering in the low light. The walls have a darkness to them as if they were charred and burned.
