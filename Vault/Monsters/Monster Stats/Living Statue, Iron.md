------

- **Immunity:** Unaffected by *sleep* spells.
- **Magical origins:** Created by powerful wizards.
- **Absorb metals:** Hits with non-magical, metal weapons cause damage, but the weapon may become stuck in the statue (**save versus spells**). Stuck weapons can be removed if the statue is killed.
- **Attacks:** Depend on the form of statue (humanoid statues may use weapons, animal statues use claws, etc.).
