------

- **Pinprick bite:** 50% chance of going unnoticed.
- **Poison:** Slow acting: effects felt after 1d4+2 turns. **Save vs poison** or die 1 turn later. At this point, the *neutralize poison* spell has a 25% chance of not working.
- **Larger individuals:** Sea snakes with more than 3 HD may be encountered. They are 6’ long for every 3 HD.
