- **Echolocation:** Unaffected by effects that impair, modify, or rely on sight. Blinded by magical silence.
- **Swarm:** 10 bats can swarm around a target’s head, causing confusion: -2 to attack rolls and saves; unable to cast spells.
- **Attacks:** As normal human.
- **Flighty:** Unless magically summoned or controlled, normal bats check morale every round.
