- **Bear hug:** If a victim is hit by both paws in the same round, the bear hugs for an extra 2d8 automatic damage.
- **Defensive:** Adults will protect their young with their lives, but otherwise only attack if cornered.
- **Camp raids:** Sometimes raid camps, for food (especially fish and sweet treats).
