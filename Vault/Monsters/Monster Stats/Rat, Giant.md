- **Disease:** Bite has a 1-in-20 chance of infecting the target (**save versus poison**). The disease has a 1-in-4 chance of being deadly (die in 1d6 days). Otherwise, the victim is sick and bedridden for one month.
- **Afraid of fire:** Will flee fire, unless forced to fight by summoner.
- **Attacking in water:** May attack without penalty; excellent swimmers.
