------

- Cautious hunters that usually avoid combat with humans unless starving or cornered. Great cats may be playful, but are quick to anger. They remain outdoors, rarely venturing deep underground.

- **Pursuit:** Always pursue prey that flees.
- **Favoured prey:** Often develop a taste for a certain type of meat (this may include humans!), hunting that creature with preference.
- **Inquisitive:** May follow PCs out of curiosity.
