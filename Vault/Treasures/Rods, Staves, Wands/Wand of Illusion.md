# Wand of Illusion

Expending a charge, an Illusion of the characterâ€™s choosing manifests. This works in the same way as the Magic-User spell **[[Phantasmal Force]]**, except:

- **Concentration:** Is required to maintain the Illusion. The wielder of the wand may move at up to half the normal movement rate while concentrating. Concentration is broken if the wielder attacks, casts a spell, or is successfully attacked (damaged, targeted by a malicious spell, etc.).
