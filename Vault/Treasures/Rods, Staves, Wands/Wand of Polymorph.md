# Wand of Polymorph

By expending a charge, the wielder of the wand or another creature within 60’ changes into another type of creature, as selected by the wielder. This works in the same way as the Magic-User Spells *[[Polymorph Self]]* and *[[Polymorph Others]]*.

- **Resisting:** An unwilling subject may make a **saving throw versus wands** to negate the effect.
