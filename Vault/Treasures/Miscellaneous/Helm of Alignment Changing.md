# Helm of Alignment Changing

A beautifully crafted but cursed helmet.

- **Putting on the helmet:** Instantly causes the wearer’s [[Alignment]] to change. The new Alignment is determined at random.
- **Removing:** The curse is such that the wearer cannot remove the helmet, once in place, and will resist attempts to remove it.
- **Dispelling:** The curse can be removed by Magic (e.g., *[[Remove Curse]]*), or (at the referee’s option) by performing a special quest.
