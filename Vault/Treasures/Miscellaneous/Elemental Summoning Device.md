# Elemental Summoning Device

Ritual items enchanted with the power to summon beings from the elemental planes. Each elemental plane has a different type of device:

- **[[Elemental, Air]]:** A censer.
- **[[Elemental, Earth]]:** A 6” diameter stone.
- **[[Elemental, Fire]]:** A brazier.
- **[[Elemental, Water]]:** A 3’ diameter bowl.

**Usage:** The items may be used as follows:

- **Frequency:** The summoning power may only be used once per day.
- **Before use:** The device must be prepared. This takes one turn.
- **Activation:** Once prepared, activating the device takes one round.
- **Summoned elemental:** A 12 HD elemental  is conjured to do the summoner’s bidding.
- **Command over the elemental:** Works as described in the [[Magic-User]] spell *Conjure Elemental* (see ***[[Conjure Elemental]]***).
