**B:** Basic Characters (levels 1–3)
**X:** Expert Characters (level 4+)

**Usage:** All Characters (unless noted).

**Identifying:** A potion may be identified by sipping a small amount. It is difficult to identify potions purely by smell or taste, as even potions with the same effect are different.

**Drinking:** Drinking a full dose of a potion takes one round

**Duration:** The magical effect of a full dose of a potion lasts for 1d6+6 turns. The referee should roll for and track this duration and keep the player from knowing how long the potion will last.

## Mixing Potions

Drinking a potion while already under the effects of another potion is dangerous:

- **Sickness:** The character is completely disabled for 3 turns due to sickness.
- **Cancellation:** The effects of both potions are canceled.

This rule does not apply to potions with instantaneous or permanent duration.
