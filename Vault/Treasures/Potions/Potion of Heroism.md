# Potion of Heroism

Normal humans and Characters of a Combat-focused, non-Magic-using class (e.g., Dwarf, Fighter, who drinks a *potion of heroism*) temporarily gain additional levels. The number of levels gained depends on the character’s normal experience level:

- **[[Normal Human]]:** Gain the abilities of a 4th-level [[Fighter]].
- **1st–3rd level:** Gain 3 levels.
- **4th–7th level:** Gain 2 levels.
- **8th–10th level:** Gain 1 level.
- **11th level+:** No effect.

**Effects:** All abilities of the additional levels are gained, including extra hit points.

**Damage:** Damage suffered while under the effects of this potion is first deducted from the pool of additional hit points granted.
