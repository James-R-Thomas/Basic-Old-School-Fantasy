# Potion of Invisibility

Drinking this potion, the character becomes invisible. This works the same as the Magic-User spell [[Invisibility]]. The standard potion duration applies.

- **Small doses:** At the refereeâ€™s discretion, a *potion of Invisibility* may be consumed in six smaller doses, each with a reduced duration.
