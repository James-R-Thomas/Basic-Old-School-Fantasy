# Ring of Spell Storing

Stores a number of magical Spells that the wearer can release on Command.

- **Capacity:** The ring contains 1d6 Spells. (The Spells can be triggered and recharged but cannot be changed.)
- **Type of Magic:** There is a 20% chance of divine Spells; otherwise, they are arcane Spells.
- **Knowledge:** The wearer of the ring knows which Spells it contains.
- **Triggering:** The ring's wearer can trigger the Spells at will (up to one spell per round).
- **Caster level:** For Spells whose effects vary by the caster's level, the ring's wearer is treated as a caster of the lowest level required to cast the spell.
- **Recharging:** Once a spell is triggered, it may not be reused until it is rechargedâ€”the expired spell must be cast directly onto the ring.
